            Automatically.<br />We may use a variety of technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing
            actions, and patterns whenever you interact with the Services, including:&nbsp;<br />(i)&nbsp;Activity
            Information.&nbsp;Details of your visits to our Services, including the types of content you&nbsp;view or engage with;
            the features you use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; the time, frequency, and

            your computer operating system, IP address, browser type, and browser language.<br />(iii)&nbsp;Location Information.
            Information about the location of your device, including&nbsp;GPS location, for purposes of enhancing or facilitating
            the Services. For example, such information may be used to enable the functionality or features of the Services that
            provide you with geographically relevant information, or&nbsp;enable you to remotely order&nbsp;and pay for the
            Services. We may also use information about the location of the device you are using to help us understand how the
            Services and functionality are being used and to deliver more relevant information or advertising.<br />The gathering of
            this information may be used for maintaining the quality of the Services we provide, as well as providing overall
            general statistics related to the use of the Services. The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may
            include:&nbsp;<br />(i)&nbsp;Cookies. A cookie is a small data file stored on the hard drive of your computer either for
            only the duration of your visit on a website ("session cookies") or for a fixed period ("persistent cookies"). Cookies
            contain information that can later be read by a web server. We may use cookies to provide you with a more personal and
            interactive experience on the Services.<br />(ii)&nbsp;Web Beacons. Web beacons are small files that are embedded in
            webpages, applications, and emails (also known as "clear gifs", "pixel tags", "web bugs", and "single-pixel gifs").
            Web beacons allow the Company, for example, to track who has visited those webpages or opened an email, to test the
            effectiveness of our marketing, and for other related website
            statistics.<br />(iii)&nbsp;JavaScripts.&nbsp;JavaScripts&nbsp;are code snippets embedded in various parts of websites
            and applications that facilitate a variety of operations including accelerating the refresh speed of certain
            functionality or monitoring usage of various online components.<br />(iv)&nbsp;Entity Tags.&nbsp;Entity Tags are HTTP
            code mechanisms that allow portions of websites to be stored or "cached" within your browser and validates these
            caches when the website is opened, accelerating website performance since the web server does not need to send a full
            response if the content has not changed.<br />(v)&nbsp;HTML5 Local Storage.&nbsp;HTML5 local storage allows data from
            websites to be stored or "cached" within your browser to store and retrieve data in HTML5 pages when the website is
            revisited.<br />(vi)&nbsp;Resettable Device Identifiers. Resettable device identifiers (also known as "advertising
            identifiers") are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the "Identifier
            for Advertisers" or "IDFA" on Apple iOS devices and the "Google Advertising ID" on Android devices), and certain
            streaming media devices. Like cookies, resettable device identifiers are used to make online advertising more
            relevant.<br />This Policy does not cover the use of tracking technologies by third parties. The Services may contain
            links, content, advertising, or references to other websites by third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and
            servers, content providers, and application providers. These third parties may use cookies or other tracking
            technologies to collect information about you when&nbsp;you use the Services. The information they collect may be
            associated with your personal information or they may collect information about your online activities over time and
            across different websites. Please be aware that we do not control these third parties' tracking technologies or when
            and how they may be used. Therefore, the Company does not claim nor accept responsibility for any privacy policies,
            practices, or procedures of any third party. We encourage you to read the privacy statements and terms&nbsp;and
            conditions of linked or referenced websites you enter. If you have any questions about an ad or other targeted
            content, you should contact the responsible provider directly.&nbsp;<br />C.&nbsp; Demographic Information.<br />We may
            collect demographic, statistical, or other aggregate information that is about you, but individually does not identify
            you. Some of this information may be derived from personal information, but it is not personal information and cannot
            be tied back to you. Examples of such aggregate information&nbsp;include gender, age, race, household income, and
            political affiliation.<br />D.&nbsp; Information from Other Sources.<br />We may receive information about you from other
            sources and add it to our account information.&nbsp; We protect this information according to the practices described
            in this Policy, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the data. These sources may include online
            and offline data providers, from which we obtain demographic, interest-based, and online advertising related data;
            publicly-available sources such as open government databases or social networks; and service providers who provide us
            with information, or updates to that information, based on their relationship with you. By gathering additional
            information about you, we can correct inaccurate information, enhance the security of your transactions, and give you
            product or service recommendations and special offers that are more likely to interest you.</p>

          <h3>6.&nbsp;Your Choices.</h3>

            choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the
            following control over your information:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />(i)&nbsp;Cookies &amp; Other Tracking Technologies. You may be
            able&nbsp;to set your browser to reject cookies and certain other technologies by adjusting the appropriate settings
            in your browser. Each browser is different, but many common browsers have preferences that may be adjusted to allow
            you to either accept or reject cookies and certain other technologies before they are set or installed, or allow you
            to remove or reject the use or installation of certain technologies altogether. We recommend that you refer to the
            Help menu in your browser to learn how to modify your browser settings.&nbsp;<br />(ii)&nbsp;Promotional Communications
            from the Company. If you do not wish to have your contact information used by the Company to promote our own or
            third-party products or services, you can opt-out by (i) informing us of your preference at the time you sign up for
            our newsletter, or complete any other form on or through the Services which we collect your data; (ii) modifying your
            user preferences in your account profile by checking or unchecking the relevant boxes; (iii) following the opt-out

            Not Track" is a privacy preference you can set in most&nbsp;web browsers. When you turn on this preference, it sends a

          <h3>7.&nbsp;Accessing and Correcting Your Information.</h3>

            or your account, copies of your User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived&nbsp;pages, or&nbsp;might have

          <h3>Legal Bases for Processing Your Information</h3>
          <p>For individuals who are located in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom or Switzerland at the time their
            personal information is collected, our legal bases for processing your information under the EU General Data
            Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) will depend on the personal information at issue, the specific context in the which the
            personal information is collected and the purposes for which it is used. We generally only process your data where we
            are legally required to, where processing is necessary to perform any contracts we entered with you (or to take steps
            at your request prior to entering into a contract with you), where processing is in our legitimate interests to
            operate our business and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms, or where
            we have obtained your consent to do so.</p>
          <p>California Privacy Rights.</p>
          <p>In addition to the rights provided for above, if you are a California resident, you have the right to request
            information from us regarding whether we share certain categories of your personal information with third parties for

            determined from the name, then examples of the products or services marketed.</p>
          <p>Pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), California residents have certain rights in
            relation to their personal information, subject to limited exceptions. If you are a California resident and would like
            a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address: 1 W. Broad Street, Suite 1004,

          <h3>9.&nbsp;How We Protect Your Information.</h3>
          <p>We take reasonable precautions to secure your personal information. We have implemented technical, physical, and
            administrative security measures designed to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or
            modification of your information. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to
            safeguard the information we collect. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers behind
            firewalls. When you transmit highly sensitive information (such as a credit card number) through the Services, we
            encrypt the transmission of that information using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.<br />The safety and security
            of your information also depend&nbsp;on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access
            to certain parts of the Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share
            your password with anyone.&nbsp;<br />For conducting cryptocurrency transactions we use third-party electronic wallet
            extensions such as Coinbase Wallet; your interactions with Coinbase Wallet and/or any third-party electronic wallet
            extensions are governed by the applicable privacy policies. In the case of Coinbase Wallet, its privacy policy is
            available <a href="https://wallet.coinbase.com/privacy-policy">here</a>.<br />While we have employed security
            technologies and procedures to assist safeguarding your personal information, no system or network can be guaranteed
            to be 100% secure. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the
            security of user information at any time. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not
            responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website or any other
            Services.</p>
