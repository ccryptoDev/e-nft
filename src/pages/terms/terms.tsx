          </p>
          <p>In our sole and absolute discretion, we reserve the right to terminate, suspend or restrict your access to any

            circumstance shall Emmersive or indemnified persons in accordance with these Terms be responsible or liable for any

            <li><strong>Creating Emmersive Items</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <p>Artists require an invitation or authorization from Emmersive to become a Creator on the Platform.&nbsp;Emmersive
            maintains complete discretion in selecting artists which will participate in its marketplace and makes no guarantees
            or promises that any artists will be approved as Creators even if Emmersive solicited the request. Emmersive reserves
            the right to change the method of Creator acceptance as we see fit. Such changes would be communicated in updated
            Terms. If you are interested in partnering with us to become a Creator, you may contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:creators@emmersiveentertainment.com">creators@emmersiveentertainment.com</a>.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Collector Rights</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <p>Once you set up your User account, you may purchase, collect, display, trade and sell your Digital Artwork, subject
            to these Terms. The description of Digital Artwork available for purchase, including, without limitation, the
            availability and configuration of any Digital Artwork will be available on the Platform prior to purchase. We reserve
            the right at any time in our discretion to determine and modify the types, configurations, prices and other components
            of any Digital Artwork.</p>
          <p>All purchases made on the Platform are final and non-refundable. Purchases may be made by credit card, bank transfer,
            or by using one or more cryptocurrencies that we may elect to accept from time to time. We retain the right in our
            discretion to limit the dollar amount of any transactions on the Platform, including, without limitation, to limit the
            amounts that may be charged to a credit card. Purchases made via credit card may be subject to a fourteen (14) day
            holding period after purchase, where you will be unable to list the purchased items for resale, and will be unable to
            export the purchased items away from the Emmersive platform.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Purchases made with cryptocurrency are irreversible. If your cryptocurrency wallet does not contain sufficient funds,
            if you initiate but do not complete a cryptocurrency payment within the anticipated timeframe, or if you otherwise
            improperly pay for an item with cryptocurrency, your cryptocurrency transaction may fail and you may pay transaction
            or network fees without receiving a corresponding Digital Artwork. Users expressly assume this risk by choosing to pay
            with cryptocurrency. Emmersive is under no obligation to accept cryptocurrencies and we retain the right in our sole
            discretion to determine what currencies or payment options to accept at any time. You acknowledge and agree that all
            cryptocurrency transactions on the Platform are publicly visible when made.</p>
          <p>By participating in a Transaction on the Platform, Collectors may purchase a non-fungible token representation of the
            Creator’s Digital Artwork. Ownership of this non-fungible token does not grant the Collector ownership of the
            underlying creative work(s) itself. The copyright and other intellectual property contained in any Digital Artwork or
            non-fungible tokens (including, without limitation, any artwork in whatever form (e.g., photographs, video, graphics,
            logos, music, images, designs or otherwise)) may be owned by Emmersive and/or a third party (or third parties). Your
            purchase of a Digital Artwork does not confer on you any such intellectual property rights and you acknowledge and
            agree that you do not have the right to use such content in any way except as specifically set forth in these Terms.
          </p>
          <p>Subject to your compliance at all times with these Terms, your valid purchase of a Digital Artwork comes with a
            limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to display the content in your Digital
            Artwork for your own personal, non-commercial use and in connection with the Platform and any platform or marketplace
            whereby you are able to engage in transactions relating to your Digital Artwork or access other content which is made
            available to holders of Digital Artwork through the Platform. Because the content may be licensed by a third party
            other than Emmersive, there may be additional restrictions associated with the use of any such content and Emmersive
            reserves the right to impose any additional restrictions on your ability to use and display such content. You agree to
            comply at all times with any such additional restrictions. Any additional benefits that are conferred directly by a
            Creator to a holder of a Digital Artwork (including but not limited to access to additional content or delivery of
            physical media) are provided “AS IS” by Creator, and such benefits are without warranty from Emmersive.</p>
          <p>The Collector’s limited license to display the Digital Artwork includes, but is not limited to, the right to, in an
            individual and non-commercial manner, to display the Digital Artwork privately or publicly: (i) for the purpose of
            promoting or sharing the Collector’s purchase, ownership, or interest, (ii) for the purpose of sharing, promoting,
            discussing, or commenting on the Digital Artwork; (iii) on third party marketplaces, exchanges, platforms, or
            applications in association with an offer to sell, purchase, or trade, the Digital Artwork; and (iv) within the
            metaverse, including decentralized virtual or augmented environments, virtual worlds, virtual galleries, virtual
            museums, or other navigable and perceivable virtual environments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>If a Collector wishes to discuss with Emmersive a license for “commercial use” of the Digital Artwork, they may
            contact Emmersive at:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:legal@emmersiveentertainment.com">legal@emmersiveentertainment.com</a>.
          </p>
          <p>The Collector agrees that it may not, nor permit any third party to, do or attempt to do any of the foregoing without
            the Creator’s express prior written consent in each case: (i) modify, distort, mutilate, or perform any other
            modification to the Digital Artwork which would be prejudicial to the Creator’s honor or reputation; (ii) use the
            Digital Artwork to advertise, market, or sell any third party product or service; (iii) use the Digital Artwork in
            connection with images, videos, or other forms of media that depict hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty,
            pornography or anything else that could reasonably be found to constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe upon the
            rights of others; (iv) incorporate the Digital Artwork in movies, videos, video games, or any other forms of media for
            a commercial purpose, except to the limited extent that such use is expressly permitted by these Terms or solely for
            Collector’s personal, non-commercial use; (v) sell, distribute for commercial gain, or otherwise commercialize
            merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the Digital Artwork; (vi) attempt to trademark, copyright, patent,
            or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to the Digital Artwork; (vii) attempt to mint,
            tokenize, or create an additional cryptographic token representing the same Digital Artwork, whether on or off of the
            Platform; (viii) falsify, misrepresent, or conceal the authorship of the Digital Artwork; or (ix) otherwise utilize
            the Digital Artwork for the Collector’s or any third party’s commercial benefit.</p>
          <p>The licenses and other provisions of this Section apply to the extent that you continue to own the Digital Artwork.
            If you sell, transfer, burn, lose access, or otherwise dispose of your Digital Artwork at any time, all licenses set
            forth in these Terms will expire upon such sale, transfer, burn or other disposal and you will not have any rights in
            any content of such Digital Artwork. Similarly, you may lose access to any content to which you are granted access to
            by virtue of your ownership of the Digital Artwork.</p>
          <p>You have the limited right to sell or transfer your Digital Artwork provided that (i) the party acquiring your
            Digital Artwork accepts all of these Terms and any other applicable third-party terms, (ii) Emmersive is paid the
            applicable transfer or other related compensation fees and (iii) You have not at any time breached these Terms. If you
            purchase or sell your Digital Artwork anywhere else other than through the Platform, you do so entirely at your own
            risk. We do not monitor or control any purchases or sales outside the Platform.</p>
          <p>Any User who creates an account on the Emmersive platform may be eligible to purchase NFTs on the Platform. This may
            include Emmersive employees as well as any affiliates, licensors, and sponsors, and each of their respective
            directors, officers, agents, contractors, partners, advisors, employees, licensors, licensees content creators, and
            suppliers.<br /><br />Collectors irrevocably release, acquit, and forever discharge Emmersive and its subsidiaries,
            affiliates, officers, and successors of any liability for direct or indirect copyright, patent or trademark
            infringement for Creator’s use of a Digital Artwork in accordance with these Terms.</p>

            <li><strong>The User Acknowledges the Functionality and Inherent Risks of the Platform</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <p>You acknowledge that the Platform is subject to security risks and flaws and acknowledge that you are solely
            responsible for evaluating any code provided by the Platform. You expressly acknowledge and assume all risks
            including, but not limited to: forgotten passwords; inability to access or use your digital wallet for any reason;
            mistyped addresses or improperly constructed instructions when transmitting or receiving an NFT or any cryptocurrency;
            errors in the NFTs or NFT smart contracts; errors in our Platform or Services; inability to access or transfer an NFT;
            inability to use, access, copy, or display any NFT, or to access, stream or view any associated media; blockchain
            malfunctions or other technical errors; server failure or data loss; telecommunications failures; unfavorable
            regulatory determinations or actions (including with respect to NFTs or cryptocurrencies); taxation of NFTs or
            cryptocurrencies; uninsured losses; unanticipated risks; volatility risks in the value of NFTs and cryptocurrencies;
            cybersecurity attacks; personal information disclosure; unauthorized access to applications; unauthorized third-party
            activities, including, without limitation, the introduction of viruses or other malicious code; and the use of
            phishing, sybil attacks, 51% attacks,&nbsp;bruteforcing, or other means of attack that affect, in any way, the NFTs or
            the associated media (the foregoing, collectively, "Platform Risks").&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>You acknowledge that you have a sufficient understanding of the functionality, usage, storage, transmission
            mechanisms and other material characteristics of, blockchain technology, NFTs, digital assets, digital wallets, and
            cryptocurrencies to understand these Terms and to appreciate the risks and implications of purchasing an NFT.</p>
          <p>You acknowledge that NFTs purchased through our Platform have no inherent or intrinsic value. The value or perceived
            value of NFTs, may be subject to significant price volatility, including risk of complete loss of value.&nbsp;In
            addition, a lack of use or public interest in NFTs could negatively impact the potential utility or value of your
            NFTs.&nbsp;We cannot guarantee that any NFT will retain its original value, as its value is inherently subjective and
            factors occurring both on and outside of the Platform may materially impact the value and desirability of any
            particular NFT. In particular, the ability to stream or view any associated media may become limited, limited in
            functionality, non-functional or obsolete and may negatively impact the value or perceived value of an NFT purchased
            through the Platform.</p>
          <p>This warning and others provided in these Terms by Emmersive in no way evidence or represent an ongoing duty to alert
            you to all of the potential risks of utilizing or accessing the Platform. The Platform may experience sophisticated
            cyber-attacks, unexpected surges in activity or other operational or technical difficulties that may cause
            interruptions to or delays on the Platform.&nbsp; You agree to accept the risk of the Platform failure resulting from
            unanticipated or heightened technical difficulties, including those resulting from sophisticated attacks, and you
            agree not to hold us accountable for any related losses.&nbsp; We will not bear any liability, whatsoever, for any
            damage or interruptions caused by any viruses that may affect your computer or other equipment, or any phishing,
            spoofing or other attack.</p>
          <p>Digital Artwork initially minted and sold on Emmersive is represented by smart contracts on a private Ethereum
            virtual machine compatible blockchain that provides a ledger of all transactions that occur on Emmersive (“the
            Emmersive Blockchain”).&nbsp; Users may be able to export certain Digital Artworks from the Emmersive Blockchain to
            the public Ethereum blockchain or Ethereum mainnet.</p>
          <p>Once a user initiates an export away from the Emmersive Blockchain, all Digital Artwork is outside of the control of
            any one party, including Emmersive, and is subject to many risks and uncertainties.&nbsp;Your sending Digital Artworks
            off of the Emmersive platform may also prevent you from using the Digital Artwork to access any media on Emmersive. We
            neither own nor control any other blockchain, any cryptocurrency wallet or address, your browser, or any other
            third-party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the
            various features of the Platform. We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of Users or any such third parties,
            nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction
            with any such third parties.&nbsp; User understands that User’s public cryptocurrency address may be made publicly
            visible whenever you engage in a Transaction on the Platform.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Users can make purchases on Emmersive using a cryptocurrency, bank transfer, or credit card, which must be paid at
            the time of purchase. Cryptocurrency purchases are made possible via Coinbase Wallet integration; thus, we are only
            able to accept cryptocurrencies supported by Coinbase Wallet and MetaMask.&nbsp;Bank transfers may be processed by
            Dwolla with varying transfer times.&nbsp;Credit card purchases will be processed via Circle. Note that funds from
            credit cards may be held, and purchases using credit cards may be subject to a fourteen (14) day holding period on
            resales and transfers out of the platform. Users understand that any use of any of these payment service providers may
            be subject to separate fees, terms and conditions provided through each of those services. When applicable, by using
            the Platform, you acknowledge and agree to the terms and conditions, and the privacy policies of such services. If you
            decide to use one of the services, you expressly grant them the right, power, and authority to access and transmit
            your information as reasonably necessary for them to provide services to you in connection with your use of the
            Platform.</p>
          <p>We have no control over these payments services, nor do we have the ability to reverse transactions (especially in
            the case of cryptocurrency payments). With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for
            any claims or damages that may arise because of any payment or transaction that you engage in via the Platform, or
            using Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via the Emmersive Blockchain, the Ethereum network,
            or any other blockchain. Emmersive is not responsible for buyers who are unable to complete payment transactions.</p>
          <p>Buyers on Emmersive will generally pay a 5% Platform Fee. Sellers on Emmersive will generally pay a 15% platform and
            creator fee. &nbsp;Emmersive or the Ethereum network may additionally require the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas
            Fee”) for transactions that occur on the Platform. You may need to pay a Gas Fee for each such transaction that occurs
            via our Platform or to export Digital Artwork off of the Platform. In addition to the Gas Fee, each time you utilize a
            Smart Contract to conduct a transaction with another user via the Platform, you authorize us to collect a commission
            or other fee for certain events (a “Commission”). These events include purchasing, selling, or trading Digital Artwork
            on the Platform. Other fees include cryptocurrency conversion fees and payment processing fees, the applicability of
            which depend on the payment method used. To transfer out Digital Artwork, Users will pay Gas Fee of $5 for the first
            token transferred out, plus $0.25 for each additional token in the transaction to transfer out (however Emmersive
            reserves the right to charge Users the actual costs of a transfer out if this amount is exceeded).</p>
          <p>Users are solely responsible to pay any and all applicable Gas Fees, minting fees, sales, use, value-added and other
            taxes, duties, and assessments now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority associated with your
            use of our Platform. You hereby authorize us to deduct any reasonable or necessary fee or tax as part of a transaction
            on the Platform. Except for income taxes levied on Emmersive, you: (i) will pay or reimburse us for all national,
            federal, state, local or other taxes and assessments of any jurisdiction, including value added taxes and taxes as
            required by international tax treaties, customs or other import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof
            based on charges set, services performed or payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed under the
            authority of any national, state, local or any other taxing jurisdiction; and (ii) shall not be entitled to deduct the
            amount of any such taxes, duties or assessments from payments made to us pursuant to these Terms. &nbsp;</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Marketplace and Auctions</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <p>The Emmersive Platform allows users to sell and purchase Digital Artwork within the Emmersive Platform. Users that
            own Digital Artwork may list such items for sale at a set price, with such listing remaining active until the Digital
            Artwork is sold or the listing is cancelled. The Platform may also allow for Users to bid on items in an auction
            format. Users that own Digital Artwork may list such items in an auction. Users may set a minimum reserve price for an
            auction sale or elect to run the auction with no reserve price set. If no reserve price is set, the work will go to
            the highest bidder at the end of the auction, whether or not the seller or buyer is satisfied with the final price.
          </p>
          <p>Once an auction is initiated, it cannot be stopped. If an auction is not cancelled before the start time, the auction
            will automatically be initiated and the auctioned work will be sold as long as the minimum reserve price is met, if
            such a price was set. Bids placed during an auction are irrevocable. Bids will only be returned if a higher bid is
            placed. Auctions may be extended in order to accommodate last minute bids. Emmersive applies the same fee structure to
            works sold in auctions as other methods. We reserve the right to screen bidders or require deposit payments towards
            large auction items.</p>
          <p>Once an item is sold, the sales proceeds due to User will be indicated in the User’s account. The sales proceeds may
            take up to thirty (30) days to clear so that they may be disbursed from Emmersive to the User. Upon eligibility to
            cash out funds, Users will be prompted with a choice to cash out via check or cryptocurrency payment, and a form to
            provide Emmersive with User’s cash out information, where they User can provide mailing address or cryptocurrency
            address. User agrees to provide correct payment information to Emmersive, and User’s failure to provide correct
            information is at User’s own risk. If a User provides an incorrect cryptocurrency address, or a non-Ethereum based
            address, they may permanent and irreversibly lose access to both their Digital Artwork and corresponding
            cryptocurrency payment.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>No Representations</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <p>Emmersive makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, written or oral, made by or on behalf of
            Emmersive in connection therewith, including any representations or warranties of title, non-infringement,
            functionality, merchantability, usage, security, suitability or fitness for any particular purpose, workmanship or
            technical quality of any Emmersive Item or work, smart contract code, or software.</p>
          <p>Emmersive shall not be liable to you for contract, tort, or any other types of damages, including indirect, special,
            incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages arising out of or related to participation in or the outcome
            of a Emmersive auction or smart contract-enabled transaction, whether or not Emmersive has been advised or knew of the
            possibility of such damages. Emmersive's liability for damages under these Terms shall in all cases be limited to, and
            under no circumstances shall exceed, the amount of auction proceeds actually received by Emmersive as profit after
            deducting all costs, fees and liabilities incurred by or on behalf of Emmersive.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Additional Ownership Rights and Storage</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <p>Emmersive partners with third-party blockchain developers to develop and maintain the Platform, to maintain various
            Platform features, and aims to keep Digital Artworks stored and exchanged on our Platform safe. When a Digital Artwork
            is conceived, listed for sale, or minted, either in a private sale or through an auction, that transaction will be
            recorded on the Emmersive Blockchain until the Digital Artwork is sold to another User or transferred off the
            Emmersive Platform.</p>
          <p>Emmersive may allow conversion of Items to the Ethereum compatible ERC 721 or ERC 1155 format. Once converted, these
            Digital Artworks can leave the Platform and be held in a User’s private wallet. As soon as the transfer of an Item is
            initiated away from the Emmersive Platform, Emmersive is not responsible nor liable for the receipt, security, or
            continued functionality of the Item.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>User understands that transfer of the Item away from the
            Platform may disable certain functions of the Item, and any such transfer is conducted at User’s own risk.
            Furthermore, Emmersive makes no representations and is absolved of all liability arising from the transfer process.
          </p>
          <p>Some Collectors may also be eligible to receive promotional physical displays for their Items. Collectors agree that
            Emmersive does not warrant that the quality of any promotional products or services purchased or obtained by you will
            meet your expectations, or that they will arrive or continue to function in an error free manner. Any promotional
            physical displays are provided “AS IS.” We do not guarantee the functionality of the displays or that the colors
            displayed on your monitor will be accurate. Shipping of physical displays is an automatic process. It is the sole
            responsibility of the Collector to ensure that the shipping information associated with the account is updated and
            accurate. Emmersive also has no liability for displays lost or damaged during the shipping process. Physical displays
            may not be resold. By confirming an order for a physical display, you certify that you are purchasing it for personal
            use only and not for resale. Purchase of displays for public or commercial use is strictly prohibited.</p>

            harmless from any from any and all losses, damages, expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, rights, claims,

            or against any liability, losses, damages or expenses incurred as a result of any action or inaction of such
            Indemnitee. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general
            release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her
            favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her

            experimental smart contract and blockchain technology, including non-fungible tokens, cryptocurrencies, consensus
            algorithms, and decentralized or peer-to-peer networks and systems. Users acknowledge and agree that such technologies
            are experimental, speculative, and inherently risky and may be subject to loss in value, obsolescence, bugs,
            malfunctions, timing errors, hacking, exploits and theft, or changes to the protocol rules of the Ethereum blockchain
            (i.e., "forks"), which can adversely affect the smart contracts and may expose you to a risk of total loss, forfeiture

          <p><strong>17.6 General Legal Terms.&nbsp;</strong>These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you
            and Emmersive and govern your use of the Platform, superseding any prior agreements between you and Emmersive with
            respect to the Platform. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use
            affiliate or third-party services, third party content or third-party software.</p>
          <p><strong>17.7 Governing Law.&nbsp;</strong>These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of
            Pennsylvania without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to
            arbitration, as set forth herein, you and Emmersive agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the
            state and federal courts located within Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. The failure of Emmersive to exercise or enforce
            any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any
            provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties
            nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the
            provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that
            regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the
            Platform or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever
            barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial
            or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same
            conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not
            assign these Terms without the prior written consent of Emmersive, but Emmersive may assign or transfer these Terms,
            in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal
            or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Platform may also provide
            notices to you of changes to these Terms or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the
            Platform.</p>

          <p><strong>17.9 Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration: PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR
              RIGHTS.</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Agreement to Arbitrate&nbsp;</strong>This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to
              in these Terms of Service as the “Arbitration Agreement.”&nbsp; You agree that any and all disputes or claims that
              have arisen or may arise between you and Emmersive, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms (including any
              alleged breach thereof), the Platforms, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us,
              shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the
              terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your
              claims qualify.&nbsp; Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the
              attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on
              your behalf.&nbsp; You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and Emmersive are each waiving the right to a
              trial by jury or to participate in a class action.&nbsp; Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not
              a judge or jury.&nbsp; The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration
              Agreement.</li>
            <li><strong>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <p><i><strong>YOU AND EMMERSIVE AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND
                NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.&nbsp; UNLESS
                BOTH YOU AND EMMERSIVE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR
                PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS
                PROCEEDING.&nbsp; ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF)
                ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF
                NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY
                AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS
                PROVISION.</strong></i></p>

            <a href="#_msocom_2">[PM2]</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp; If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration
            must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”).&nbsp; The Notice to Emmersive
            should be sent to 1 W. Broad Street, Suite 1004 Bethlehem, PA 18018 (“Notice Address”).&nbsp; The Notice must (i)
            describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.&nbsp; If
            Emmersive and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or
            Emmersive may commence an arbitration proceeding.&nbsp; During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer
            made by Emmersive or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if
            any, to which you or Emmersive is entitled.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Arbitration Procedures.&nbsp;</strong>Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance
              with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration
              Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp; For information on the AAA,
              please visit its website, http://www.adr.org.&nbsp; Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes
              can be found at the AAA’s consumer arbitration page,&nbsp;
              <a href="http://www.adr.org/">http://www.adr.org/</a>&nbsp;as may be updated from time to time.&nbsp; If there is any
              inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of
              this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent
              Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration.&nbsp; The arbitrator must also
              follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would.&nbsp; All issues are for the arbitrator to decide,
              including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration
              Agreement.&nbsp; Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other
              judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can
              award to an individual under the Terms of Service and applicable law.&nbsp; Decisions by the arbitrator are
              enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unless Emmersive and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place at the AAA Philadelphia
              Regional Office .&nbsp; If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Emmersive agrees that you may choose whether the
              arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic or
              videoconference hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.&nbsp; If your claim exceeds
              $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.&nbsp; Regardless of the manner in which the
              arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential
              findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Costs of Arbitration.&nbsp;</strong>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees
              (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this
              Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp; If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Emmersive will
              pay all Arbitration Fees.&nbsp; If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate
              to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator
              otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees,
              Emmersive will pay your portion of such fees.&nbsp; In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs
              of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Emmersive will pay as much of the
              Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.&nbsp; Any
              payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <p>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly
            confidential for the benefit of all parties.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Severability</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <p>If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the
            subsection (b) titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” above) is
            invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid
            and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
            and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.&nbsp; If a court or the arbitrator decides that
            any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and
            Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null
            and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public
            injunctive relief.&nbsp; The remainder of the Terms of Service will continue to apply.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <p>Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Service to the contrary, Emmersive agrees that if it makes any future
            change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the
            Platforms, you may reject any such change by sending Emmersive written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the
            change to the Notice Address provided above.&nbsp; By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will
            arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you
            first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service).</p>

          <p><strong>&nbsp;Tory Lanez Drop Terms of Service</strong></p>
          <p><i>Purchasing Your Tory Lanez NFT –</i></p>
          <p>Tory Lanez NFTs are a limited-edition album with only one million copies available, and was sold out as of August 10,
            2021. After being sold out, any purchaser that would like to acquire a Tory Lanez NFT must do so from the resale
            market, located at the Emmersive Marketplace. Tory Lanez NFTs were initially sold by Emmersive to purchasers for $1,
            but on resale each owner of a Tory Lanez NFT has the power to list their NFT for a price of their choosing. Emmersive
            does not set these prices or manage those sales. Purchasers must use their Tory Lanez NFT on the Emmersive Platform
            located at e-nft.com to access and stream the Tory Lanez album When It’s Dark. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Payment for any Tory Lanez NFTs through the Marketplace must be made in full at the time of payment. All sales are
            final and no refunds or exchanges will be permitted. Purchases can be made by credit card, bank transfer, or
            cryptocurrency after connecting your compatible cryptocurrency wallet (Coinbase Wallet and MetaMask are supported at
            this time).</p>
          <p><i>Selling Your Tory Lanez NFT on our Marketplace</i></p>
          <p>All sales of Tory Lanez NFTs are final, and once payment is confirmed you will no longer have access to that edition
            of your NFT. Sellers cannot cancel a transaction once the process has begun. Emmersive is not liable for any payment
            transactions that are not completed. Sellers agree to a 15% Platform &amp; Creator fee which will be deducted from
            your sales price.</p>
          <p><i>Ownership Rights –</i></p>
          <p>When you purchase a Tory Lanez NFT in accordance with our Terms, you have full ownership rights of the NFT, including
            the right to store, sell, and transfer your NFT. Additionally, your NFT allows you, during your period of ownership,
            to stream the Tony Lanez album, titled <i>When It's Dark</i>. However, you acknowledge that your purchase does not
            provide any rights, express or implied, in the underlying music, art, or other media embodied within the Tory Lanez
            NFT, other than a limited license to stream the included music tracks and view the associated artwork, for your own
            personal, non-commercial use or in connection with a proposed sale or transfer of the Tory Lanez NFT. If you choose to
            transfer your Tory Lanez NFT to an external wallet, you will only be able to stream the album by logging into the
            Emmersive service.</p>
          <p><i>Restrictions on Ownership –</i></p>
          <p>You agree that you may not, nor permit any third party to, do or attempt to do any of the foregoing without our
            express prior written consent in each case: (a) download any of the music tracks from the Emmersive platform; (b)
            modify the artwork of any purchased NFT in any way, including, without limitation, the shapes, designs, drawings,
            attributes, or color schemes; (c) use the tracks or the artwork in connection with images, videos, or other forms of
            media that depict hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be found to
            constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others; (d) sell, distribute for commercial gain
            (including, without limitation, giving away in the hopes of eventual commercial gain), or otherwise commercialize
            merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the purchased NFT artwork; (f) attempt to trademark, copyright, or
            otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to the music tracks or the NFT artwork; or (g)
            otherwise utilize any of the purchased NFTs for your or any third party's commercial benefit.</p>
          <p><strong>E-NFT Marketplace Code of Conduct</strong></p>
          <p>The purpose of this document is to provide a general overview of best practices for engaging with the Emmersive E-NFT
            Marketplace. This document is intended to help you get the most out of your experience, and will be updated
            continuously as new community feedback is received.</p>
          <p>1. We strongly urge users to only transact on the E-NFT Marketplace. Any private transaction is at your own risk and
            it is highly unlikely that we will be able to help you in any way if something goes wrong. No Emmersive employee or
            representative will ever ask you for the password to your account nor will they ever ask for a seed phrase to a
            third-party wallet.</p>
          <p>2. If you are ever unsure about whether Emmersive is trying to contact you, please reach out to support directly
            through our website so that we can verify. If you feel you have been contacted maliciously by someone portraying
            themselves as an employee of Emmersive, please let us know so that we can forward that information to the proper
            authorities.</p>
          <p>3. Each user may only have one account. &nbsp;This is to ensure fairness for limited drops and to avoid confusion
            within our system. If a user is suspected to have multiple accounts, we reserve the right to freeze that account while
            an internal investigation takes place. If, after such an investigation, it is determined that a user has violated the
            one account policy, we may close all of the user’s accounts permanently and confiscate any NFTs in those accounts.</p>
          <p>4. Bot usage of any kind is strictly prohibited on the Emmersive platform. This includes using a bot to create
            additional user accounts or to gain an advantage for NFT releases. If our software determines that you are using a bot
            to pursue an unfair competitive advantage, we reserve the right to freeze your account without any warning and
            confiscate any items that were acquired as the result of such activities.</p>
          <p>5. You may not purchase, sell, or transfer a user account to another person or entity in exchange for cash or
            cryptocurrency outside of a manner authorized by Emmersive. This includes selling any funds in your account as well as
            selling an account that wins any random draw we may potentially run for a release.</p>
          <p>6. You may not impersonate any celebrity or athlete on the Emmersive Platform.</p>
          <p>7. Entering into agreements with other users to buy each other’s NFTs to manipulate prices is strictly prohibited, as
            is any other form of market manipulation. This includes conspiring in the creation of or participating in an organized
            “pump and dump” or other similar scheme.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Karen Drop TOS Draft</strong></p>
          <p><i>Purchasing Your Karen NFT –</i></p>
          <p>Users will be able to purchase Karen – The Movie NFTs starting on September 21, 2021. Payment must be made in full at
            the time of purchase. All sales are final and no refunds or exchanges will be permitted. Purchases can be made by
            credit card, bank transfer, or cryptocurrency after connecting your compatible cryptocurrency wallet (Coinbase Wallet
            and MetaMask are supported at this time). Open Edition NFTs can be purchased until October 21st and will not be
            limited in quantity. There will only be 5,000 Limited Edition Karen NFTs. Once the Limited NFTs are sold out, they
            will never be re-released. For full details on the content of the Karen NFTs please visit
            https://e-nft.curios.com/nft/karen/. &nbsp;</p>
          <p><i>Ownership Rights –</i></p>
          <p>When you purchase a Karen NFT in accordance with our Terms, you have full ownership rights of the NFT, including the
            right to store, sell, and transfer your Karen NFT. However, you acknowledge that your purchase does not provide any
            rights, express or implied, in the Karen NFT other than a limited license to stream the included music tracks and view
            and display associated artwork, music videos, and director commentary, for your own personal, non-commercial use and
            in connection with a proposed sale or transfer of the Karen NFT. If you choose to transfer your Karen NFT to an
            external wallet, you will only be able to stream the tracks by returning to the site and connecting your wallet to
            verify that you still own the NFT. Owning a Karen NFT does not grant any ownership of IP related to the production of
            Karen – The Movie.</p>
          <p>Any user who creates an account on the Emmersive platform is eligible to purchase the Karen NFT. This includes all
            Emmersive employees as well as any affiliates, licensors, and sponsors, and each of their respective directors,
            officers, agents, contractors, partners, advisors, employees, licensors, content creators, and suppliers.</p>
          <p><br /><i>Restrictions on Ownership –</i></p>
          <p>You agree that you may not, nor permit any third party to do or attempt to do any of the foregoing without our
            express prior written consent in each case: (a) download any of the music tracks from the Emmersive platform; (b)
            modify the artwork of any purchased NFT in any way, including, without limitation, the shapes, designs, drawings,
            attributes, or color schemes; (c) use the tracks or the artwork in connection with images, videos, or other forms of
            media that depict hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be found to
            constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others; (d) sell, distribute for commercial gain
            (including, without limitation, giving away in the hopes of eventual commercial gain), or otherwise commercialize
            merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the purchased NFT artwork; (f) attempt to trademark, copyright, or
            otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to the music tracks or the NFT artwork; or (g)
            otherwise utilize any of the purchased NFTs for your or any third party’s commercial benefit.&nbsp;<br />Acknowledgments
            and Assumptions of Risk –</p>
          <p>You acknowledge that the prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile, subjective and have noninherent or
            intrinsic value. &nbsp;Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect Karen
            NFTs, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. &nbsp;In addition, a lack of use or public interest
            in NFTs could negatively impact the potential utility or value of your Karen NFTs. There is no guarantee that any
            particular Karen NFT will retain its original value, as the value is inherently subjective and factors occurring
            outside of the Platform may materially impact the value and desirability of the NFTs.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
