          - Bootsy Collins
        </h3>
        <h4>Bootsy Collins</h4>
        <p>
          Bootsy Collins is one of the all-time great funk and R&amp;B
          bassists/singer/bandleaders/music producers; as well as the number
          four bassist of all time as recognized by Rolling Stone Magazine.
          From 1969 to 1971, Bootsy’s group The Pacemakers functioned as James
          Brown’s backup band and was dubbed “The J.B.’s.” In 1972, Bootsy
          joined George Clinton’s Parliament/Funkadelic. Collins and Clinton
          soon established a lifelong personal and musical friendship. Collins
          then launched Bootsy’s Rubber Band as a spinoff of P-Funk in 1976.
          Collins’ inspired, clever progressions and patterns were a vital
          part of such records as "Get Up, I Feel Like Being a Sex Machine."
        </p>
        <p>
          Bootsy Collins’ influence on popular culture is inescapable. His
          SOUND and LOOK are literally stitched into the fabric of modern
          music, be it R&amp;B, Funk, Rock, Hip-Hop or EDM. Snoop Dogg,
          Outkast, Flea, Dr. Dre, Rick James, Prince, Daft Punk, Primus, and
          Thundercat— just to name a few— are all Brother-Nature’s disciples.
          Today, a whole new generation of music fans have embraced Bootsy’s
          legacy via Childish Gambino’s platinum hit "Redbone," a loving
          homage to Collins' 70's smash "I'd Rather be with You;" as well as
          via “Silk Sonic,” the name given by Collins to Bruno Mars &amp;
          Anderson .Paak and their sultry album guest starring the Funkmaster
          himself Bootsy. All of Bootsy’s musical success has allowed him and
          wife Patti to give back to community organizations and other support
          efforts through the Bootsy Collins Foundation, whose Mission is to
          inspire, educate, and enrich the lives of all individuals from all
          backgrounds.
